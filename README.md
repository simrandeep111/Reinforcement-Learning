ðŸš€ Simple Reinforcement Learning: Grid World Example ðŸš€

I recently developed a class-based reinforcement learning implementation that features a custom grid world environment and a Q-learning agent. This example code is a great starting point for understanding how agents interact with environments to learn optimal policies through exploration and exploitation. The design separates the logic into distinct classes for the environment, agent, and overall simulation, making it modular and easy to extend. Check out some key highlights:

ðŸ¤– Agent & Environment Separation: Clear division between the agent's decision-making and the environment's response.

ðŸ§  Q-Learning Algorithm: Implements a basic Q-learning update rule for state-action value estimation.

ðŸŽ¯ Simple Grid World: An intuitive grid environment where the goal is to reach the bottom-right corner.

ðŸ“ˆ Modular & Extendable: Designed with classes for easy modifications and future enhancements.

ðŸ’¡ Epsilon-Greedy Policy: Balances exploration and exploitation for optimal learning.
